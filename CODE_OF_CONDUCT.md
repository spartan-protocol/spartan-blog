Spartan Protocol Code of Conduct


Introduction

Spartan Protocol is a Decentralised Finance (DeFi) project aiming to provide liquidity pools with the automated market maker mechanic. Our goal is to create a fully decentralised autonomous organisation (referred therefore as DAO) that can function as an autonomous entity. The scope for this code of conduct is to pave the right path for information flow as much outwards (other projects, entities, individuals) and inwards (individuals having governance rights and voting in the DAO).


Core Values

The cornerstone of Spartan Protocol is to develop a strong community based on integrity of ethos and unrestricted and verified information, while respecting the right to anonymity and privacy. Such a community is inclusive to people of all gender identification and expression, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, and educational background. Members of the group are automatically referred as “Spartans” if they wish, irrespectively to any possible traits or backgrounds. Three words can be used to briefly describe our vision: Freedom, Solidarity, Integrity

A project created by the community, for the community. This means that there are no sovereign individuals holding a big percentage of the protocol tokens (and voting rights) by default. Only the free market develops the inflow and outflow of tokens.
 
No developer (the term developer is therefore used for software developer, marketing manager, community administrator, or contributor in general) has ever been rewarded for his contribution by the protocol treasury. No developer (or contributor) will ever be rewarded in the present and future for his contributions on the protocol, and any requests or business proposals will be turned down automatically, except if an individual member agrees to lease a worker with expenses covered totally by himself. 

The project starts as decentralised as possible and continues to further distribute as time goes on.

The Protocol strives towards being completely autonomous with no requirement for ongoing maintenance.
Being an economic product, the goal is to achieve the ideal of decentralisation and autonomy as much as possible.

By having a DAO, information flow and discussion is critical. Our main and regulated channels of information will be regulated based on the following core values:

We believe in the right to privacy, and every member has the right to stay anonymous (anon) and reserves the right to deny any requests for his identity immediately. Repeated or aggressive requests to reveal identity will be treated as major harassment and result in heavy moderation by administrators

We believe in the moto “Don’t trust - verify” and we urge our members to always keep this in mind, always striving to verify information and facts.
We believe in the right of free speech, and every member reserves the right to communicate his ideas respectfully to other members and always based on facts and sources that others can verify, or at least by explaining his reasoning in depth when inquired. Personal opinions not accompanied by strong facts, or without complying with inquiry and reasoning will result in moderation in the DAO discussion server. Community channels for discussion of personal opinions with minimal moderation will exist, and members will reserve their right to choose the sources of their information. 

In accordance to the right to free speech, we state that we are inclusive to members freely revealing identity or positive commentary on all of the following:	

* gender identity and expression
* age
* sexual orientation
* disability
* physical appearance
* body size
* race
* ethnicity
* nationality
* religion
* political views
* Software development experience or lack of

In accordance to the right of free speech and freely expressing opinions, it is stated that every member has the right to express his opinions (accompanied by facts) no matter his previous experience, economic or software development background. We wish to value free thinking, and not technical expertise. Our rule to build a strong argument based on facts or logical arguments still apply.

We believe that every member reserves the right for any action needed to maximise his own profit. Opinions, decisions and arguments based on the profit of the individual are to be respected as a core value of the protocol, and the protocol evolution should strive to collectively maximise individual profits. That being said, it is worth mentioning that the protocol is based not in a zero-sum game, but strives to “make the pie bigger for everyone to share”

Harassment of any form in the official community channel and the DAO discussion channel will not be tolerated and will result in heavy moderation.  


Expected Behaviours

Strive to be a source of verified information, and fight disinformation. Always try to back up your arguments to ensure what is true or not, and provoke thinking. Always inquire the statements of peers. Critique is to be given and received only based on facts and never on personal opinion, even if it includes strong logical arguments.

Support community members by being civil and well-mannered, tolerant of their level of language use and level of understanding on the nuances of the protocol. 

Share ideas freely, since the base profit mechanic of the protocol is based on collaboration due to the liquidity pools. Information asymmetry is an important source of profit for other projects, but in regards to the system of Spartan Protocol, collaboration in ideas and suggestions will “make the pie bigger for everyone to share”


Unaccepted behaviours and what we define as harassment

Language use should be neutral, limit expressive language down to its bare basics in order to avoid misunderstandings and offending other members. It is strictly forbidden to use language with  reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion. Due to the particular mythology of Spartan Protocol, we feel the need to specify that by the term “Spartan” we include all individuals of the community who participate in it, irrespective of their beliefs, preferences, traits, or background, and irrespective to the number of tokens or LP tokens held. Any attack on the status of a community member as “Spartan” due to the aforementioned exceptions will not be tolerated. 
Messages including abusive language in terms of discrimination, ridicule, sexuality, or even [microaggressions](https://www.vox.com/2015/2/16/8031073/what-are-microaggressions) will be considered as harassment and be heavily moderated.
Commentary with the intent to spread fear uncertainty and distrust without sufficient evidence or logical argument upon enquiry will be heavily moderated as an act of market manipulation. 
Humorous remarks that are covering up microagressions or violating any of the above statements will not be tolerated. 
Passive-aggressive behaviour with he purposes of victimisation and martyrdom  as defined by [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive-aggressive_behavior) and [this example](https://www.healthline.com/health/passive-aggressive-personality-disorder) will be confronted and if not resolved, moderated. 

When confronted with the above behaviours, a Spartan can try and resolve the issue directly, or invoke/mention the community administrators to take swift action upon the matter.


Commitment to improvement

This Code of Conduct will function as a constitution for the DAO at its basic values. Still, nothing is perfect from the start, so in the last lines we commit on improving it and making it a just system of rules for the governance of the protocol. Anyone is free to propose, discuss and implement his own ideas upon it, as long as they do not violate the core values of freedom, solidarity and integrity.
